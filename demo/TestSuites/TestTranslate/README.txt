Demo: Translate demo
====================

Introduction
============

This sample demonstrates how to perform test of web application using Selenium.

This demo is provided as example and may not run in your own environment without adaptation.

However, it gives a good idea about how to perform automated tests. Please see the Translate video" in order to see it in action.

Pre-Requisites
==============
- firefox (tested with version 3.x)
- Optional: Internet Explorer (tested with version 6 and 7) but to use Internet Explorer you have to change the testdata with "*iexplore" as BROWSER string, 
            by default, the demo will use firefox. The current version of selenium doesn't seem to run well on Internet Explorer 8.
- JDK 1.6
